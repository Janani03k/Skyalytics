Navigating US Air Traffic - Performance and Delay Factors in Domestic Flights

Website Link: https://sites.google.com/view/skyalytics/home?authuser=0

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the performance and delay factors in US domestic flights using Flourish. We aim to provide insights into various aspects of air travel efficiency through a comprehensive visualization dashboard. The analysis uncovers patterns and trends related to delays, cancellations, and diversions, offering a deep understanding of the underlying factors affecting the punctuality and reliability of major airlines.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing extensive domestic flight data, which includes:
- On-time performance of major airlines
- Delays categorized by weather, technical issues, and other factors
- Cancellations and diversions
- Identification of recurring issues and performance trends

The dashboard is designed to benefit stakeholders such as airlines, travelers, and policymakers by providing valuable insights into the air travel system's efficiency.

## Dataset

The data used for this project is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and includes comprehensive records on flight performance, including delays, cancellations, and diversions. Utilized datasets from Kaggle for our analysis:
- [Airline Delay Causes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses?resource=download)
- [Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset (2019-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023)
